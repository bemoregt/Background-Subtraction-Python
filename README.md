# Background-Subtraction-Python

To get the combined frame with Background Subtraction
Background subtraction, also known as foreground detection, is a technique in the fields of image processing and computer vision wherein an image's foreground is extracted for further processing (object recognition etc.). Generally an image's regions of interest are objects (humans, cars, text etc.) in its foreground. After the stage of image preprocessing (which may include image denoising, post processing like morphology etc.) object localisation is required which may make use of this technique.
